	# Suppose I have modified a file named "password" and have two branches,
	# "password-expiry-mechanism" and "password-reset-mail". If I want to
	# switch to either branch, I would type "git checkout pass<Tab><Enter>",
	# but the autocomplete would stop at "git checkout password" because of
	# the ambiguity. Because I press <Enter> without really thinking, I have
	# now reset my "password" file. With "git go pass<Tab><Enter>", I would
	# simply have created a new branch called "password". (I would be forced
	# to use "--" to separate paths from banch names, which is a Good Thingâ„¢.)
